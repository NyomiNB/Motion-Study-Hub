<h1>Maximize your time with the Pomodoro Technique!</h1>
      <h2>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h2>
         <p>Did you know Pomodoro is actually Itallian for "tomato"? You may be wondering, "Did a farmer develop this technique?" or maybe a chef? The Pomodoro Technique was actually a study method originating from software engineer, Francesco Crillo, during his time as a university student. Crillio was looking for a way to manage his time efficiently, and discovered this method of studying with nothing but his tomato-shaped kitchen timer, hence the name "Pomodoro". </p>
                  <h3>How to Use the Pomodoro Technique</h3>
   <p>It's simple really! Each task is called a "pomodoro." Each "pomodoro" gets allocated 25 minutes. After the 25 minutes is up, take a 5-minute break. You repeat this process until you have completed 4 pomodoros, or a total of an hour and twenty minutes of work time. After the fourth pomodoro, you take a longer 15-minute break and repeat the process until you've completed your tasks!</p>
